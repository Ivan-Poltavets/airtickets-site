        <h2>How to return or change avia ticket?</h2>
        <p>
            To issue a refund or change in an air ticket, you must submit an application from your personal account on the avia-tickets.com website, or write a request to e-mail support@e-bilet.com.ua, indicating your booking details and order number. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Attention! Detailed information on the rules for changing or canceling air tickets can be found in the User Agreement of our website at the link. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Accurate information on the rules for refund or change for each specific air ticket can be provided by our online support by phone, chat, or by e-mail support@e-bilet.com.ua.
         If voluntary, i.e. at the initiative of the user, the return or exchange of an air ticket issued for a previously issued Order, the Supplier's rules corresponding to the selected fare are applied. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the user pays the Company a service fee for the procedure for registering a return or changes (departure date or surname) in the amount of UAH 600. (UAH 400 for air tickets issued before January 20, 2021), including if the circumstances are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>illness of a passenger or his close relative; </li>
            <li>refusal to issue a visa; </li>
            <li>forced changes or cancellations of flights; </li>
            <li>force majeure. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Flights with the cheapest fares of low-cost airlines such as ryanair, wizzair generally cannot be changed or canceled. Buying a paid support level "Standard" or "Comfort" does not guarantee the ability to change or cancel an air ticket, if this is not provided for by the airline's fare rules.
            If the Client is forced to exchange or return previously ordered air tickets, he must submit a request to change or return the order for each air ticket separately.
            Each ticket requires separate application of the relevant Fare Rules. 
            </p>
        <p>
            If the initiator and executor of the transfer and / or cancellation of the flight is the Supplier, the Client, at the discretion of the Supplier, and especially in relation to flights issued within the framework of one ticket, may count on one of the compensation methods: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>an alternative booking option; 
            </li>
            <li>ticket refund. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Documents confirming the reason for the Client's submission of a request to change or return an order will be considered separately for each ticket if the circumstances are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>illness / death of a passenger or his close relative; 
            </li>
            <li>refusal to issue a visa. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Company does not bear any responsibility for the final decision of the Supplier, who is solely authorized to decide whether it is possible to carry out the following in relation to the Order placed by the Client: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the change;</li>
            <li>return. </li>
        </ul>
