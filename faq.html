        <h2>Air tickets</h2>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show')">What is an electronic ticket? </p>
        <p class="show" style="display: none;">An electronic ticket is an electronic document certifying an air carriage agreement between a passenger and an airline. Unlike a paper ticket, an e-ticket is a digital entry in the airline's database. An electronic ticket does not require a special form - all information is stored in the memory of computers and, if necessary, is quickly transferred from one computer to another. In addition, the introduction of electronic ticket technologies allows passengers to buy air tickets for relatives who live in another country, saves time for buying air tickets, makes it possible to independently choose a route for themselves and pay for transportation in one click of the mouse. But the biggest advantage of an electronic ticket is that it cannot be lost. </p>
        <p class="show" style="display: none;">Electronic tickets can be booked both in the traditional way (through operators and computer booking systems), and independently by passengers through the websites of airlines and agencies. Payment for the ticket can also be done both in the traditional way (in cash to the cashier) and by means of electronic payments. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show2')">What is a route sheet? </p>
        <p class="show2" style="display: none;">Itinerary sheet is a document that contains information about the flight and is part of the agency's electronic ticket. Includes: flight segments, airport and terminal of departure and arrival of the flight, flight number, air ticket number, agency and / or airline booking number, agency and airline name, baggage allowance, form of payment, general remarks about additional services. </p>
        <p class="show2" style="display: none;">The itinerary sheet is sent to the passenger by e-mail in the form of a file attached to the letter. The PDF format allows the agent and clients to ensure that the presentation of the content remains unchanged in transit. </p>
        <p class="quest"onclick="show('show3')" >What documents are required for the flight? </p>
        <p class="show3" style="display: none;">Sometimes even frequent flyers need additional information about documents and much more. This list most often includes: the passenger's passport, visa, accompanying documents, air ticket and medical insurance. </p>
        <p class="show3" style="display: none;">If you are traveling in Ukraine or to countries that do not require a passport for Ukrainians to enter, you should pay attention that the civil internal passport is valid, with photos pasted in upon reaching 25 and 45 years old. Also, do not forget about certain periods of validity of the passport, depending on the country you wish to visit. Including a visa or accompanying documents are also included in the list of necessary travel documents - you can always check this information on the official website http://mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/travel-advice/entering-foreign- countries. </p>
        <p class="show3" style="display: none;">It is also worth paying attention to the child's documents - if minor children (under 16 years old) are traveling with adults, it is necessary to present the original of the child's birth certificate at customs control. Children 16 and over must have their own passport. It is also very important to pay attention to the fact that some airlines do not accept children with a birth certificate, among them BELAVIA - you must have your own travel document. </p>
        <p class="show3" style="display: none;">To fly abroad, the child must have his own passport or be entered in the passport of one of the parents. Children traveling without parents or without one of the parents must have a notarized travel permit. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show4')">How to issue a ticket refund or how to change the data on the ticket? </p>
        <p class="show4" style="display: none;">You need to apply for a refund for air tickets issued on the website e-bilet.com.ua, and you also need to provide a copy of your civil passport (page 1,2 and registration), a copy of the TIN and bank details of the payer's card for transferring funds. </p>
        <p class="show4" style="display: none;"><b>ATTENTION!</b>
            This form is used to request a refund for unused / partially used tickets issued at refundable rates exclusively on the website https://e-bilet.com.ua/ </p> 
         <p class="show4" style="display: none;">Any changes / cancellations of a completed booking cannot be made from the website. To make changes / cancellations of reservations, please contact the staff by phone or online chat. For questions related to the processing of applications, you can contact the support service by e-mail admin@e-bilet.com.ua </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show5')">What is check-in? </p>
        <p class="show5" style="display: none;">Passengers are checked-in for the flight through a computerized passenger departure control system installed at the airport. Previously, information about issued tickets is transmitted to this system from the booking systems. When registering a passenger using an electronic ticket, it is necessary to present an identity card (passport) of the passenger, as well as, in some cases, an itinerary receipt (not necessarily, all the necessary information is already in the system).

            During check-in, the passenger is issued a boarding pass indicating the time of boarding the aircraft, the boarding gate and the seat on board the aircraft. </p>
        
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show6')">How do I check in for a flight? </p>
        <p class="show6" style="display: none;">When registering a passenger using an electronic ticket, it is necessary to present an itinerary receipt (optional), all the necessary information is already in the system, a passenger's identity card (passport) is sufficient. During check-in, the passenger is issued a boarding pass indicating the time of boarding the aircraft, the boarding gate and the seat on board the aircraft. It is worth noting that each airline may have its own rules for setting the start and end times of check-in at the airport. According to the standard, check-in starts 2 hours before departure and ends 40 minutes before departure, after which boarding begins. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show7')">How do I check in for a flight online? </p>
        <p class="show7" style="display: none;">There is a preliminary online registration on the airline's website, access to which opens 24 hours before departure (for some airlines, 48 ​​hours before departure, and for some low-cost airlines, 30 days before departure). If the passenger checked in for the flight on his own via the Internet, then it is necessary to print out the boarding pass or save the check-in barcode on the gadget. In any case, we recommend that you approach the check-in counter at the airport, since many airports in the world have not connected a system for reading electronic information about electronic check-in. If you are sure that the airport services will be able to read information from your electronic boarding pass, you can immediately go to passport control (if you are traveling without luggage). </p>
        <p class="show7" style="display: none;">It is necessary to read the information on the electronic boarding pass very carefully, it is not always possible to go straight to the inspection and passport control. </p>
        <p class="show7" style="display: none;">The boarding pass is the main document for allowing a passenger to enter the pre-flight security area and board the plane. This approach unifies the work of airport employees at the stage from passenger check-in to boarding the plane. You also need to check in your baggage at the check-in counter. </p>
        <p class="show7" style="display: none;">In addition, some airlines provide a check-in service at a self-service terminal directly at the airport. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show8')">How do I get my booking number? </p>
        <p class="show8" style="display: none;">The booking number will be sent to you in your confirmation email and will also be displayed on the order confirmation page.

            On the website <a href="https://viewtrip.travelport.com/">https://viewtrip.travelport.com/</a> you can check the status of your booking. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show9')">Accompanying children </p>
        <p class="show9" style="display: none;">Airlines have a special service for accompanying minor children if their parents / guardians cannot fly with the child for any reason. The exception is low-cost companies: Wizzair (a child can fly alone from the age of 14), Ryanair (a child can fly unaccompanied by an adult from the age of 16). </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show10')">Requirements for declaration </p>
        <p class="show10" style="display: none;">Requirements for declaring in all countries and airports are individual. Before departure, be sure to study them on the websites of the airports of departure / transit / arrival, where you can also view and download the forms. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show11')">Seat selection on the plane </p>
        <p class="show11" style="display: none;">You get the seat number by checking in for a flight at the airport or online (you can choose a seat yourself). The choice of a seat in the 1st row and near emergency exits (not always an available option) for many airlines is carried out for a fee. </p>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show12')">Meals on board </p>
        <p class="show12" style="display: none;">Meals on the plane depend on the airline, the duration of the flight and the class of service. On low-cost airlines, more often than not, an additional fee will be required for lunch. You can find out if lunch is included and what is included in it from our consultants. </p>
        
        <h2>Charter flights </h2>
        <p class="quest" onclick="show('show13')">What is a charter flight? </p>
